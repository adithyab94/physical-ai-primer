Fix with actuator characterization (torque-speed limits, latency measurement) or an actuator network, then a delta-action model if agile skills still deviate. Randomization alone likely made the policy conservative elsewhere." },
    { q: "What consumes the sim–real correlation number, and what happens if it is not computed?", a: "[[s:10]] uses it to decide whether a sim benchmark can gate releases; [[s:12]] uses gated results for rollout decisions; [[s:07]] uses sim evals for checkpoint selection. Without it, teams select checkpoints on sim scores that may anti-correlate with real performance and ship regressions." },
    { q: "Co-training improved grasp success but not insertion. Why is that expected?", a: "Sim reproduces visual approach and rigid grasping reasonably; insertion depends on contact mechanics (friction, compliance, latch forces) that are poorly modelled, so sim demos teach approach behaviour but not the force-sensitive phase. Use real data and residual RL for the contact phase; consider weighting sim data by subtask." },
    { q: "Why must a GS-reconstructed evaluation scene be paired with object poses and collision meshes?", a: "The splat provides appearance for rendering camera observations; it has no geometry for physics. Any object the robot touches needs a collision proxy with the right pose, mass and friction; otherwise the policy's actions have no physical consequence in the eval." },
    { q: "When is real2sim2real worth more than collecting more real data?", a: "When variation at a site is large but structured (layouts, object placements), RL in a twin can cover thousands of configurations cheaply, and the twin can be reused for regression testing. When the failure mode is contact physics or deformables, the twin is too wrong and real data wins." }
